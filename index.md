# About

I have 10 years of experiences in software developement for various clients in different fields. Jake of all trades, i like to get my hand dirty and always learning. I don't forgot the good practices and make delivery goes faster. The separate of concern is my mojo and teams make my works much more enjoyable.

Most of the times i do PHP and bash scripting, but i also did some projects in Perl and i am productive in Javascript. I have some projects in Dart too, this way i can deliver android and ios apps.

Of course, i can code from scratch but i do prefer to use framework from very talented peoples and iterate on it. This way symfony is my favorite, Flutter impress me a lot and VueJS is always on my list.

In my free times, i am also studying HAMradio, sailing, traveling and enjoying good foods.
