# About

Hello, welcome to my personal website!

I've been a developer for about 10 years. I like well-structured projects that allow me and the teams I work with to be effective on our objectives. I like to have a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship" target="_blank">software craftman</a>" spirit, even if the size of the initial project is "small". 

You never know where the project will take you. :)

Most of the time, I do PHP and bash scripts, but I've also worked on Perl and I'm productive in Javascript. I also have a few personal projects in Dart.

Of course, I can code from scratch, but I prefer to use the frameworks of very talented people and iterate on them. As a result, symfony is my favorite, Flutter impresses me a lot and VueJS is always on my list.

In my spare time, I'm studying to be a radio amateur, sailing, traveling and enjoying good food.
