*knock, knock*

Ho ... Ho hai thar !

At first, i thought i could make up myself to have a blog that i would update regularly ...

Well i think i totally failed this part since my first and last post ahah. :)

Now that i am (a bit) more experienced, i feel more confident about what i can add to the network. I will still try to openly write about what i like, think or even some technical share. Mostly in english for my training but probably also in French my native idiom. Please write me at "jeremie [at] gaven [dot] me" if you have any correction (english or whatever)! (or give me a pull request for geeks out there)

The goal hasn't changed and the motivation has increase !

See ya !
